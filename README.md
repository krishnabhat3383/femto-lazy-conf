# ðŸ’¤ Femto Conf for LazyVim

No longer: A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

This is a custom config for lazyvim distro of neovim specifically tailored to the "IDE" that I personally want to work with.
